# Reserving your Pi on CHI@Edge

First, ensure that your pi was added to Chi@Edge properly. This can be done by checking the [Chi@Edge device calendar](https://chi.edge.chameleoncloud.org/project/leases/calendar/device/) and seeing if your pi is one of the devices listed. If it shows up, you are good to go ahead and follow the next steps to create a reservation for it. If not, you may have made a mistake in the steps from the previous page.&#x20;

Creating reservations for both the pi and a bare-metal node is done using this [Trovi artifact](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share/8800ebd1-411e-4e94-9b62-6883f09188e7).&#x20;
