Put these screws in a bag or secure place in case they are needed later

4. Attach chassis wires to expansion board
   1. Find the two sets of black, white, and red wires
   2. Identify the connections on the under side of the expansion board left of where the camera is mounted
   3. Wire from the lower part of the chassis connects to the port closer to the battery
   4. Wire from the upper part of the chassis connects to the port further away from the battery
   5. Both wires connect with the white wire on the inside of the board

&#x20; Rest the expansion board on top of the chassis

While holding the standoffs in place between the chassis and the board, tighten the screws ensuring that the end of the screw reaches all the way down through the standoff to the hole in the chassiS.&#x20;

_Note: tighten each screw loosely at first, then tighten all screws_

7. Attach the Jetson Nano to the expansion board
   1. Use 4 M2.5\*5 screws
   2. Place Jetson Nano on top of expansion board and line up with four holes
